# Studyleit 

Studyleit is an Object-Oriented JavaScript application for creating and practicing decks of flash cards that is built on a Ruby-on-Rails API backend. 

The name is spelled as it is because leit is a reference to the Leitner System for memorization, and future versions will incorporate features based on these concepts.
